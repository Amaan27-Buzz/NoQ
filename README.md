# NoQ
## Dynamic Queue System

The **NoQ Dynamic Queue System** allows for a wide way of virtual queues to be implemented.

## User App:
1. User logs in and selects the service (bank counter, doctor, store billing counter, etc.)
2. Books a virtual token for their visit
3. The app shows real-time queue status and estimated waiting time, reminders/notifications as turn approaches - cancel/reschedule as needed
4. Time slots are assigned on a first-come, first-served basis.

## Service Provider Dashboard:
1. Current queue status
2. Crowdsourced data of people waiting , served, and pending (collected from users of NoQ)
3. AI-based analysis of peak times and crowd prediction (potential)
4. Public Transport Integration (alternative application):
5. Syncs with public transport API like Open Transit Data (DMRC)
6. Best transport routes and timings for the user’s booked slot
7. Avoid delays due to transportation issues
